    * Zero Movement
    * We are building a platform that requires us to process large amounts of data.
    * We have noticed that our system is slowed down by the presence of zeros in our integer arrays.
    * We need a function that can move all the zeros to the end of the array without changing the order
    * of the other elements. Bonus: Can you achieve this without copying the list (in-place)?
