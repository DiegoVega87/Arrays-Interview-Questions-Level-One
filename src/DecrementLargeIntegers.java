    * Decrementing Large Integers
    * Our startup focuses on optimizing operations for large integers represented as integer arrays.
    * Currently, we're facing a challenge in implementing a function that efficiently decrements a
    * given large integer by one. The expected outcome is an integer array containing the digits of
    * the decremented value.
    *
    * Example 1:
    *   int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    *   result should be {1, 2, 3, 3}
    *
    * Example 2:
    *   int[] arr = {9, 9, 9, 9};
    *   result should be {9, 9, 9, 8}
    *
    * Example 3:
    *   int[] arr = {1, 0, 0, 0};
    *   result should be {0, 9, 9, 9}
    * */
