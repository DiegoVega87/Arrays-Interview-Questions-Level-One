    /*
    * We have a list of numbers representing the prices of our products. We want to create a feature
    * that allows our users to search for pairs of products whose prices add up to a specific target amount.
    * Write a function that takes in an array of integers representing the prices of our products and an integer target,
    * and returns the indices of the two products whose prices add up to the target amount.
    * Each product can only be used once and the output can be in any order.
    *
    * Example 1:
    *   prices = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    *   target = 60;
    *   expectedOutput = {0, 4};
    *   Explanation: The prices at indices 0 and 4 add up to the target amount of 60.
    *
    * Example 2:
    *   prices = {5, 15, 25, 35, 45};
    *   target = 40;
    *   expectedOutput = {1, 2};
