    * Identify Unique Customer
    * You have a list of customer IDs in an array called ""customerIDs"".
    * Each customer ID appears twice except for one unique customer.
    *  Write a function to identify the unique customer ID.
    * Can you identify a solution that only needs linear run time?
    *
    * Example 1:
    *   customerIDs = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4};
    *   Output: 5
    *
    * Example 2:
    *   customerIDs = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    *   Output: 60
