    * Our startup is developing a photo editing app, and we need to implement a feature that allows users
    * to rotate their (squared) images by 180 degrees. The output should be the same 2D matrix with the rotated image.
    *
    * Example 1:
    *   image = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};
    *   expectedOutput = {{9, 8, 7}, {6, 5, 4}, {3, 2, 1}};
    *
    * Example 2:
    *   image = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}};
    *   expectedOutput = {{4, 3}, {2, 1}};
     * */
