    * You are building a platform that allows users to upload and share their favorite products.
    * To ensure the quality of the platform, you want to detect if any product is uploaded more than once.
    * You have an array of integers representing the product IDs uploaded by users.
    * Write a function that takes in an integer array and returns true if any value appears at least twice in the array,
    * and false if every element is distinct.
    *
    * Example 1:
    *   [] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    *   result = false
    *
    * Example 2:
    *   arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1};
    *   result = true
    *
    * Logic: Go element by element and return true when one has already been seen. False otherwise.
    *
    * Brute force approach:  Two for loops to compare each element with all the other elements O(n^2)
    * A more efficient approach would be to use a data structure that does not accept duplicates
    * without having to compare all the numbers one by one.
