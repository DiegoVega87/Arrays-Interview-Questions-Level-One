    * Array Intersection for Sales Analytics
    * As a sales analytics startup, we need to identify the common customers between two sales datasets.
    * We have two integer arrays representing the customer IDs of each dataset.
    * We need a function that returns an array of the customer IDs that appear in both datasets.
    * The output should contain each customer ID as many times as it appears in both datasets and can be in any order.
    * Can you help us write a function that solves this problem efficiently?
    *
    * Example 1:
    *   dataset1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    *   dataset2 = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8};
    *   expectedOutput = {4, 5};
    *
    * Example 2:
    *   dataset1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    *   dataset2 = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
    *   expectedOutput = {};
    * */
